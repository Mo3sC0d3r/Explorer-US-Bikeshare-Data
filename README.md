### Explorer US Bikeshare Data Python Project

### Description
In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and also a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Software I needed include:
Python 3, NumPy and pandas installing using Anaconda
A text editor like sublime or atom
A terminal application (Terminal or Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows)

Statistics Computed
1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
	most common month
	most common day of week
	most common hour of day
2. Popular stations and trip
	most common start station
	most common end station
	most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)
3. Trip duration
	total travel time
	average travel time
4. User info
	counts of each user type
	counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
	earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)


### Files used
chicago.csv

new_york_city.csv

washington.csv


### Credits
All credit goes to the udacity resources tab where I downloaded most of the files I used and to the pandas documentaion especially the indexing and selecting data page
